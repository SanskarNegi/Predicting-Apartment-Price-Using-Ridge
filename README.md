# Predicting-Apartment-Price-Using-Ridge
Predcting Apartment Price based on size, location and neighborhood using "ridge regression".

This project is created to build a model that predict the apartment price using different features, Evaluating of all the features in our dataset for use in our model. We are using "Ridge Regression" in our model to predict apartment price.

This Repo include following files
- **README.md:** This file, which contains a summary of files used for this project
- **Predicting Apartment Price Using Ridge Regression.ipynb:** python notebook where all the task has performed on our data
- **buenos-aires-1.csv:** Our first csv file, from where we are getting our data 
- **buenos-aires-2.csv:** Our second csv file, from where we are getting our data 
- **buenos-aires-3.csv:** Our third csv file, from where we are getting our data 
- **buenos-aires-4.csv:** Our fourth csv file, from where we are getting our data 
- **buenos-aires-5.csv:** Our fifth csv file, from where we are getting our data 

## Getting Started
### Environment
* pandas
