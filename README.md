# Predicting-Apartment-Price-Using-Ridge
Predicting Apartment Price based on size, location and neighbourhood using "ridge regression".

This project is created to build a model that predict the apartment price using different features, Performed Data Wrangling and Created Pipeline for model creation. We are using "Ridge Regression" in our model to predict apartment price.

This Repo include following files
- **README.md:** This file, which contains a summary of files used for this project
- **Predicting Apartment Price Using Ridge Regression.ipynb:** python notebook where all the task has performed on our data
- **buenos-aires-1.csv:** Our first csv file, from where we are getting our data 
- **buenos-aires-2.csv:** Our second csv file, from where we are getting our data 
- **buenos-aires-3.csv:** Our third csv file, from where we are getting our data 
- **buenos-aires-4.csv:** Our fourth csv file, from where we are getting our data 
- **buenos-aires-5.csv:** Our fifth csv file, from where we are getting our data 

## Getting Started
### Environment
* pandas
* matplotlib
* seaborn
* glob
* category encoder (OneHotEncoder)
* sklearn
* ipywidget

### Installing
* you can download our Predicting Apartment Price Using Ridge Regression.ipynb and all the csv files from the repository.
* Now you can run this programm on jupyter notebook, any python notebook or any python IDE.
* Before running programm you have to specify your file path in glob method (file path where you have downloaded csv files).
```
files = glob("F:filepath/buenos-aires-*.csv")
```
